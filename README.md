For installation & running the app best use: Yarn - Dependency Management

Open terminal, run "yarn install" start or "npm install" depending on your setup. Then run "yarn start" or "npm start" This will run the app on port 3000 in your web browser.

Possible improvements:

1 error handlers around the api requests

2 there is small gap before the pokemon image is shown, loading state could be added

3 tests should be added

Possible difficulties:

1  my learning goal for this challenge was to work with styled components, so may have used styling not in the most efficient way

2 if material ui is not common to use around the team, the Search component may be more difficult to custom than the element that is built from scratch.
